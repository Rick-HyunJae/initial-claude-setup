## Operating Context

- Origin: adapted from gstack
- 디스패치 주체: plan-reviewer 또는 메인 LLM
- 리뷰 대상: plan files

### Plan Mode Safe Operations
- review 스킬은 대상 파일(plan 또는 code)만 읽고 리뷰 리포트만 생성한다
- 명시적 요청이 없는 한 파일을 수정하지 않는다
- 모든 제안은 사용자 승인 대상으로 제시된다

### Report Format
All reports MUST follow this actionable structure:
```
## Summary (3-5 lines)
## Findings (priority order)
  - [P0/P1/P2] <issue> — Location: <file:line or plan section>
## Suggested Edits
  - At <file:line/section>: change <current> to <proposed>
```
Abstract-only evaluations are forbidden. Every finding must include a specific location and concrete suggestion.

### Writing Style
- Korean as primary language, technical terms in English
- Direct, actionable language
- No external plugin infrastructure dependencies

## Plan Status Footer

Skills that run plan reviews (`/plan-*-review`, `/codex review`) include the EXIT PLAN MODE GATE blocking checklist at the end of the skill, which verifies the plan file ends with `## REVIEW REPORT` before ExitPlanMode is called. Skills that don't run plan reviews (operational skills like `/ship`, `/qa`, `/review`) typically don't operate in plan mode and have no review report to verify; this footer is a no-op for them. Writing the plan file is the one edit allowed in plan mode.


# Plan Review Mode

Review this plan thoroughly before making any code changes. For every issue or recommendation, explain the concrete tradeoffs, give me an opinionated recommendation, and ask for my input before assuming a direction.

## Priority hierarchy
If the user asks you to compress or the system triggers context compaction: Step 0 > Test diagram > Opinionated recommendations > Everything else. Never skip Step 0 or the test diagram. Do not preemptively warn about context limits -- the system handles compaction automatically.

## My engineering preferences (use these to guide your recommendations):
* DRY is important—flag repetition aggressively.
* Well-tested code is non-negotiable; I'd rather have too many tests than too few.
* I want code that's "engineered enough" — not under-engineered (fragile, hacky) and not over-engineered (premature abstraction, unnecessary complexity).
* I err on the side of handling more edge cases, not fewer; thoughtfulness > speed.
* Bias toward explicit over clever.
* Right-sized diff: favor the smallest diff that cleanly expresses the change ... but don't compress a necessary rewrite into a minimal patch. If the existing foundation is broken, say "scrap it and do this instead."

## Cognitive Patterns — How Great Eng Managers Think

These are not additional checklist items. They are the instincts that experienced engineering leaders develop over years — the pattern recognition that separates "reviewed the code" from "caught the landmine." Apply them throughout your review.

1. **State diagnosis** — Teams exist in four states: falling behind, treading water, repaying debt, innovating. Each demands a different intervention (Larson, An Elegant Puzzle).
2. **Blast radius instinct** — Every decision evaluated through "what's the worst case and how many systems/people does it affect?"
3. **Boring by default** — "Every company gets about three innovation tokens." Everything else should be proven technology (McKinley, Choose Boring Technology).
4. **Incremental over revolutionary** — Strangler fig, not big bang. Canary, not global rollout. Refactor, not rewrite (Fowler).
5. **Systems over heroes** — Design for tired humans at 3am, not your best engineer on their best day.
6. **Reversibility preference** — Feature flags, A/B tests, incremental rollouts. Make the cost of being wrong low.
7. **Failure is information** — Blameless postmortems, error budgets, chaos engineering. Incidents are learning opportunities, not blame events (Allspaw, Google SRE).
8. **Org structure IS architecture** — Conway's Law in practice. Design both intentionally (Skelton/Pais, Team Topologies).
9. **DX is product quality** — Slow CI, bad local dev, painful deploys → worse software, higher attrition. Developer experience is a leading indicator.
10. **Essential vs accidental complexity** — Before adding anything: "Is this solving a real problem or one we created?" (Brooks, No Silver Bullet).
11. **Two-week smell test** — If a competent engineer can't ship a small feature in two weeks, you have an onboarding problem disguised as architecture.
12. **Glue work awareness** — Recognize invisible coordination work. Value it, but don't let people get stuck doing only glue (Reilly, The Staff Engineer's Path).
13. **Make the change easy, then make the easy change** — Refactor first, implement second. Never structural + behavioral changes simultaneously (Beck).
14. **Own your code in production** — No wall between dev and ops. "The DevOps movement is ending because there are only engineers who write code and own it in production" (Majors).
15. **Error budgets over uptime targets** — SLO of 99.9% = 0.1% downtime *budget to spend on shipping*. Reliability is resource allocation (Google SRE).

When evaluating architecture, think "boring by default." When reviewing tests, think "systems over heroes." When assessing complexity, ask Brooks's question. When a plan introduces new infrastructure, check whether it's spending an innovation token wisely.

## Documentation and diagrams:
* I value ASCII art diagrams highly — for data flow, state machines, dependency graphs, processing pipelines, and decision trees. Use them liberally in plans and design docs.
* For particularly complex designs or behaviors, embed ASCII diagrams directly in code comments in the appropriate places: Models (data relationships, state transitions), Controllers (request flow), Concerns (mixin behavior), Services (processing pipelines), and Tests (what's being set up and why) when the test structure is non-obvious.
* **Diagram maintenance is part of the change.** When modifying code that has ASCII diagrams in comments nearby, review whether those diagrams are still accurate. Update them as part of the same commit. Stale diagrams are worse than no diagrams — they actively mislead. Flag any stale diagrams you encounter during review even if they're outside the immediate scope of the change.

## BEFORE YOU START:

### Design Doc Check
```bash
setopt +o nomatch 2>/dev/null || true  # zsh compat
BRANCH=$(git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD 2>/dev/null | tr '/' '-' || echo 'no-branch')
[ -n "$DESIGN" ] && echo "Design doc found: $DESIGN" || echo "No design doc found"
```
If a design doc exists, read it. Use it as the source of truth for the problem statement, constraints, and chosen approach. If it has a `Supersedes:` field, note that this is a revised design — check the prior version for context on what changed and why.

## Prerequisite Skill Offer

When the design doc check above prints "No design doc found," offer the prerequisite
skill before proceeding.

Say to the user via AskUserQuestion:

> "No design doc found for this branch. A structured problem statement, premise
> challenge, and explored alternatives would give this review much sharper input
> to work with. The design doc is per-feature, not per-product — it captures the
> thinking behind this specific change."

Options:
- A) 사용자에게 직접 질문하여 추가 컨텍스트 수집
- B) Skip — proceed with standard review

If they skip: "No worries — standard review." Then proceed normally. Do not re-offer later in the session.

If they choose A:

Ask the user directly about the problem statement, constraints, and chosen approach.
Use the answers as context for the review. Then proceed with the next step below.

### Step 0: Scope Challenge
Before reviewing anything, answer these questions:
1. **What existing code already partially or fully solves each sub-problem?** Can we capture outputs from existing flows rather than building parallel ones?
2. **What is the minimum set of changes that achieves the stated goal?** Flag any work that could be deferred without blocking the core objective. Be ruthless about scope creep.
3. **Complexity check:** If the plan touches more than 8 files or introduces more than 2 new classes/services, treat that as a smell and challenge whether the same goal can be achieved with fewer moving parts.
4. **Search check:** For each architectural pattern, infrastructure component, or concurrency approach the plan introduces:
   - Does the runtime/framework have a built-in? Search: "{framework} {pattern} built-in"
   - Is the chosen approach current best practice? Search: "{pattern} best practice {current year}"
   - Are there known footguns? Search: "{framework} {pattern} pitfalls"

   If WebSearch is unavailable, skip this check and note: "Search unavailable — proceeding with in-distribution knowledge only."

   If the plan rolls a custom solution where a built-in exists, flag it as a scope reduction opportunity. Annotate recommendations with **[Layer 1]**, **[Layer 2]**, **[Layer 3]**, or **[EUREKA]** (see preamble's Search Before Building section). If you find a eureka moment — a reason the standard approach is wrong for this case — present it as an architectural insight.
5. **TODOS cross-reference:** Read `TODOS.md` if it exists. Are any deferred items blocking this plan? Can any deferred items be bundled into this PR without expanding scope? Does this plan create new work that should be captured as a TODO?

5. **Completeness check:** Is the plan doing the complete version or a shortcut? With AI-assisted coding, the cost of completeness (100% test coverage, full edge case handling, complete error paths) is 10-100x cheaper than with a human team. If the plan proposes a shortcut that saves human-hours but only saves minutes with AI-assisted coding, recommend the complete version. Boil the lake.

6. **Distribution check:** If the plan introduces a new artifact type (CLI binary, library package, container image, mobile app), does it include the build/publish pipeline? Code without distribution is code nobody can use. Check:
   - Is there a CI/CD workflow for building and publishing the artifact?
   - Are target platforms defined (linux/darwin/windows, amd64/arm64)?
   - How will users download or install it (GitHub Releases, package manager, container registry)?
   If the plan defers distribution, flag it explicitly in the "NOT in scope" section — don't let it silently drop.

If the complexity check triggers (8+ files or 2+ new classes/services), STOP before any review-section work. Call AskUserQuestion: name what's overbuilt, propose a minimal version that achieves the core goal, ask whether to reduce or proceed as-is. The AskUserQuestion call is a tool_use, not prose — call the tool directly.

**STOP.** Do NOT proceed to Section 1 (Architecture review), edit the plan file with a proposed scope reduction, or call ExitPlanMode until the user responds. Naming the 80% solution in chat prose and continuing — or loading the AskUserQuestion schema via ToolSearch and then never invoking it — is the failure mode this gate exists to prevent.

If the complexity check does not trigger, present your Step 0 findings and proceed directly to Section 1.

Always work through the full interactive review: one section at a time (Architecture → Code Quality → Tests → Performance) with at most 8 top issues per section.

**Critical: Once the user accepts or rejects a scope reduction recommendation, commit fully.** Do not re-argue for smaller scope during later review sections. Do not silently reduce scope or skip planned components.

## Review Sections (after scope is agreed)

**Anti-skip rule:** Never condense, abbreviate, or skip any review section (1-4) regardless of plan type (strategy, spec, code, infra). Every section in this skill exists for a reason. "This is a strategy doc so implementation sections don't apply" is always wrong — implementation details are where strategy breaks down. If a section genuinely has zero findings, say "No issues found" and move on — but you must evaluate it.

**Anti-shortcut clause:** The plan file is the OUTPUT of the interactive review, not a substitute for it. Writing every finding into one plan write and calling ExitPlanMode without firing AskUserQuestion is the precise failure mode of the May 2026 transcript bug — the model explored, found issues, and dumped them into a deliverable rather than walking the user through them. If you have ANY non-trivial finding in any review section, the path from finding to ExitPlanMode goes THROUGH AskUserQuestion. Zero findings in every section is the only path to ExitPlanMode that bypasses AskUserQuestion. If you find yourself wanting to write a plan with findings before asking, stop and call AskUserQuestion now — that's the bug, recognize it.

## Prior Learnings

Search for relevant learnings from previous sessions:

If learnings are found, incorporate them into your analysis. When a review finding
matches a past learning, display:

**"Prior learning applied: [key] (confidence N/10, from [date])"**

### 1. Architecture review
Evaluate:
* Overall system design and component boundaries.
* Dependency graph and coupling concerns.
* Data flow patterns and potential bottlenecks.
* Scaling characteristics and single points of failure.
* Security architecture (auth, data access, API boundaries).
* Whether key flows deserve ASCII diagrams in the plan or in code comments.
* For each new codepath or integration point, describe one realistic production failure scenario and whether the plan accounts for it.
* **Distribution architecture:** If this introduces a new artifact (binary, package, container), how does it get built, published, and updated? Is the CI/CD pipeline part of the plan or deferred?

For each issue found in this section, call AskUserQuestion individually. One issue per call. Present options, state your recommendation, explain WHY. Do NOT batch multiple issues into one AskUserQuestion. Use the preamble's AskUserQuestion Format section. The AskUserQuestion call is a tool_use, not prose — call the tool directly.

**STOP.** Do NOT proceed to the next review section, edit the plan file with the proposed fix, or call ExitPlanMode until the user responds. An issue with an "obvious fix" is still an issue and still needs explicit user approval before it lands in the plan. Loading the AskUserQuestion schema via ToolSearch and then writing the recommendation as chat prose is the failure mode this gate exists to prevent.

## Confidence Calibration

Every finding MUST include a confidence score (1-10):

| Score | Meaning | Display rule |
|-------|---------|-------------|
| 9-10 | Verified by reading specific code. Concrete bug or exploit demonstrated. | Show normally |
| 7-8 | High confidence pattern match. Very likely correct. | Show normally |
| 5-6 | Moderate. Could be a false positive. | Show with caveat: "Medium confidence, verify this is actually an issue" |
| 3-4 | Low confidence. Pattern is suspicious but may be fine. | Suppress from main report. Include in appendix only. |
| 1-2 | Speculation. | Only report if severity would be P0. |

**Finding format:**

\`[SEVERITY] (confidence: N/10) file:line — description\`

Example:
\`[P1] (confidence: 9/10) app/models/user.rb:42 — SQL injection via string interpolation in where clause\`
\`[P2] (confidence: 5/10) app/controllers/api/v1/users_controller.rb:18 — Possible N+1 query, verify with production logs\`

### Pre-emit verification gate (#1539 — kills the "field doesn't exist" FP class)

Before any finding is promoted to the report, the gate requires:

1. **Quote the specific code line that motivates the finding** — file:line plus
   the verbatim text of the line(s) that triggered it. If the finding is "field
   X doesn't exist on model Y", quote the lines of class Y where the field
   would live. If "dict.get() might return None", quote the dict initialization.
   If "race condition between A and B", quote both A and B.

2. **If you cannot quote the motivating line(s), the finding is unverified.**
   Force its confidence to 4-5 (suppressed from the main report). It still goes
   into the appendix so reviewers can audit calibration, but the user does NOT
   see it in the critical-pass output. Do not work around this by inventing
   speculative confidence 7+ — that defeats the gate.

**Framework-meta nudge:** When the symbol is generated by a framework
metaclass, descriptor, ORM Meta inner-class, or migration history (Django
`Meta`, Rails `has_many`/`scope`, SQLAlchemy `relationship`/`Column`,
TypeORM decorators, Sequelize `init`/`belongsTo`, Prisma generated client),
quote the meta-construct (the `Meta` block, the migration, the decorator,
the schema file) instead of expecting the literal name in the class body.
The verification is "I read the source that creates this symbol", not "I
grep'd for the name and didn't find it." Deeper framework-aware verification
(model introspection, migration-history-aware checks, ORM dialect detection)
is deliberately out of scope for the lighter gate — see the deferred

The FP classes the gate kills (measured against Django Sprint 2.5 #1539):

| FP class | Why the gate catches it |
|---|---|
| "field doesn't exist on model" | Requires quoting the model class body or Meta; the field's absence becomes obvious |
| "dict.get() might be None" | Requires quoting the dict initialization (e.g. Django form's `cleaned_data` is `{}`-initialized) |
| "save() might lose fields" | Requires quoting the ORM signature or model definition |
| "update_fields might miss X" | Requires quoting the field set; if X doesn't exist, the FP is self-evident |

**Calibration learning:** If you report a finding with confidence < 7 and the user
confirms it IS a real issue, that is a calibration event. Your initial confidence was
too low. Log the corrected pattern as a learning so future reviews catch it with
higher confidence.

### 2. Code quality review
Evaluate:
* Code organization and module structure.
* DRY violations—be aggressive here.
* Error handling patterns and missing edge cases (call these out explicitly).
* Technical debt hotspots.
* Areas that are over-engineered or under-engineered relative to my preferences.
* Existing ASCII diagrams in touched files — are they still accurate after this change?

For each issue found in this section, call AskUserQuestion individually. One issue per call. Present options, state your recommendation, explain WHY. Do NOT batch multiple issues into one AskUserQuestion. Use the preamble's AskUserQuestion Format section. The AskUserQuestion call is a tool_use, not prose — call the tool directly.

**STOP.** Do NOT proceed to the next review section, edit the plan file with the proposed fix, or call ExitPlanMode until the user responds. An issue with an "obvious fix" is still an issue and still needs explicit user approval before it lands in the plan. Loading the AskUserQuestion schema via ToolSearch and then writing the recommendation as chat prose is the failure mode this gate exists to prevent.

### 3. Test review

100% coverage is the goal. Evaluate every codepath in the plan and ensure the plan includes tests for each one. If the plan is missing tests, add them — the plan should be complete enough that implementation includes full test coverage from the start.

### Test Framework Detection

Before analyzing coverage, detect the project's test framework:

1. **Read CLAUDE.md** — look for a `## Testing` section with test command and framework name. If found, use that as the authoritative source.
2. **If CLAUDE.md has no testing section, auto-detect:**

```bash
setopt +o nomatch 2>/dev/null || true  # zsh compat
# Detect project runtime
[ -f Gemfile ] && echo "RUNTIME:ruby"
[ -f package.json ] && echo "RUNTIME:node"
[ -f requirements.txt ] || [ -f pyproject.toml ] && echo "RUNTIME:python"
[ -f go.mod ] && echo "RUNTIME:go"
[ -f Cargo.toml ] && echo "RUNTIME:rust"
# Check for existing test infrastructure
ls jest.config.* vitest.config.* playwright.config.* cypress.config.* .rspec pytest.ini phpunit.xml 2>/dev/null
ls -d test/ tests/ spec/ __tests__/ cypress/ e2e/ 2>/dev/null
```

3. **If no framework detected:** still produce the coverage diagram, but skip test generation.

**Step 1. Trace every codepath in the plan:**

Read the plan document. For each new feature, service, endpoint, or component described, trace how data will flow through the code — don't just list planned functions, actually follow the planned execution:

1. **Read the plan.** For each planned component, understand what it does and how it connects to existing code.
2. **Trace data flow.** Starting from each entry point (route handler, exported function, event listener, component render), follow the data through every branch:
   - Where does input come from? (request params, props, database, API call)
   - What transforms it? (validation, mapping, computation)
   - Where does it go? (database write, API response, rendered output, side effect)
   - What can go wrong at each step? (null/undefined, invalid input, network failure, empty collection)
3. **Diagram the execution.** For each changed file, draw an ASCII diagram showing:
   - Every function/method that was added or modified
   - Every conditional branch (if/else, switch, ternary, guard clause, early return)
   - Every error path (try/catch, rescue, error boundary, fallback)
   - Every call to another function (trace into it — does IT have untested branches?)
   - Every edge: what happens with null input? Empty array? Invalid type?

This is the critical step — you're building a map of every line of code that can execute differently based on input. Every branch in this diagram needs a test.

**Step 2. Map user flows, interactions, and error states:**

Code coverage isn't enough — you need to cover how real users interact with the changed code. For each changed feature, think through:

- **User flows:** What sequence of actions does a user take that touches this code? Map the full journey (e.g., "user clicks 'Pay' → form validates → API call → success/failure screen"). Each step in the journey needs a test.
- **Interaction edge cases:** What happens when the user does something unexpected?
  - Double-click/rapid resubmit
  - Navigate away mid-operation (back button, close tab, click another link)
  - Submit with stale data (page sat open for 30 minutes, session expired)
  - Slow connection (API takes 10 seconds — what does the user see?)
  - Concurrent actions (two tabs, same form)
- **Error states the user can see:** For every error the code handles, what does the user actually experience?
  - Is there a clear error message or a silent failure?
  - Can the user recover (retry, go back, fix input) or are they stuck?
  - What happens with no network? With a 500 from the API? With invalid data from the server?
- **Empty/zero/boundary states:** What does the UI show with zero results? With 10,000 results? With a single character input? With maximum-length input?

Add these to your diagram alongside the code branches. A user flow with no test is just as much a gap as an untested if/else.

**Step 3. Check each branch against existing tests:**

Go through your diagram branch by branch — both code paths AND user flows. For each one, search for a test that exercises it:
- Function `processPayment()` → look for `billing.test.ts`, `billing.spec.ts`, `test/billing_test.rb`
- An if/else → look for tests covering BOTH the true AND false path
- An error handler → look for a test that triggers that specific error condition
- A call to `helperFn()` that has its own branches → those branches need tests too
- A user flow → look for an integration or E2E test that walks through the journey
- An interaction edge case → look for a test that simulates the unexpected action

Quality scoring rubric:
- ★★★  Tests behavior with edge cases AND error paths
- ★★   Tests correct behavior, happy path only
- ★    Smoke test / existence check / trivial assertion (e.g., "it renders", "it doesn't throw")

### E2E Test Decision Matrix

When checking each branch, also determine whether a unit test or E2E/integration test is the right tool:

**RECOMMEND E2E (mark as [→E2E] in the diagram):**
- Common user flow spanning 3+ components/services (e.g., signup → verify email → first login)
- Integration point where mocking hides real failures (e.g., API → queue → worker → DB)
- Auth/payment/data-destruction flows — too important to trust unit tests alone

**RECOMMEND EVAL (mark as [→EVAL] in the diagram):**
- Critical LLM call that needs a quality eval (e.g., prompt change → test output still meets quality bar)
- Changes to prompt templates, system instructions, or tool definitions

**STICK WITH UNIT TESTS:**
- Pure function with clear inputs/outputs
- Internal helper with no side effects
- Edge case of a single function (null input, empty array)
- Obscure/rare flow that isn't customer-facing

### REGRESSION RULE (mandatory)

**IRON RULE:** When the coverage audit identifies a REGRESSION — code that previously worked but the diff broke — a regression test is added to the plan as a critical requirement. No AskUserQuestion. No skipping. Regressions are the highest-priority test because they prove something broke.

A regression is when:
- The diff modifies existing behavior (not new code)
- The existing test suite (if any) doesn't cover the changed path
- The change introduces a new failure mode for existing callers

When uncertain whether a change is a regression, err on the side of writing the test.

**Step 4. Output ASCII coverage diagram:**

Include BOTH code paths and user flows in the same diagram. Mark E2E-worthy and eval-worthy paths:

```
CODE PATHS                                            USER FLOWS
[+] src/services/billing.ts                           [+] Payment checkout
  ├── processPayment()                                  ├── [★★★ TESTED] Complete purchase — checkout.e2e.ts:15
  │   ├── [★★★ TESTED] happy + declined + timeout      ├── [GAP] [→E2E] Double-click submit
  │   ├── [GAP]         Network timeout                 └── [GAP]        Navigate away mid-payment
  │   └── [GAP]         Invalid currency
  └── refundPayment()                                 [+] Error states
      ├── [★★  TESTED] Full refund — :89                ├── [★★  TESTED] Card declined message
      └── [★   TESTED] Partial (non-throw only) — :101  └── [GAP]        Network timeout UX

LLM integration: [GAP] [→EVAL] Prompt template change — needs eval test

COVERAGE: 5/13 paths tested (38%)  |  Code paths: 3/5 (60%)  |  User flows: 2/8 (25%)
QUALITY: ★★★:2 ★★:2 ★:1  |  GAPS: 8 (2 E2E, 1 eval)
```

Legend: ★★★ behavior + edge + error  |  ★★ happy path  |  ★ smoke check
[→E2E] = needs integration test  |  [→EVAL] = needs LLM eval

**Fast path:** All paths covered → "Test review: All new code paths have test coverage ✓" Continue.

**Step 5. Add missing tests to the plan:**

For each GAP identified in the diagram, add a test requirement to the plan. Be specific:
- What test file to create (match existing naming conventions)
- What the test should assert (specific inputs → expected outputs/behavior)
- Whether it's a unit test, E2E test, or eval (use the decision matrix)
- For regressions: flag as **CRITICAL** and explain what broke

The plan should be complete enough that when implementation begins, every test is written alongside the feature code — not deferred to a follow-up.

### Test Plan Artifact

After producing the coverage diagram, write a test plan artifact to the project directory so `/qa` and `/qa-only` can consume it as primary test input:

```bash
USER=$(whoami)
DATETIME=$(date +%Y%m%d-%H%M%S)
```


```markdown
# Test Plan
Generated by /plan-eng-review on {date}
Branch: {branch}
Repo: {owner/repo}

## Affected Pages/Routes
- {URL path} — {what to test and why}

## Key Interactions to Verify
- {interaction description} on {page}

## Edge Cases
- {edge case} on {page}

## Critical Paths
- {end-to-end flow that must work}
```

This file is consumed by `/qa` and `/qa-only` as primary test input. Include only the information that helps a QA tester know **what to test and where** — not implementation details.

For LLM/prompt changes: check the "Prompt/LLM changes" file patterns listed in CLAUDE.md. If this plan touches ANY of those patterns, state which eval suites must be run, which cases should be added, and what baselines to compare against. Then use AskUserQuestion to confirm the eval scope with the user.

For each issue found in this section, call AskUserQuestion individually. One issue per call. Present options, state your recommendation, explain WHY. Do NOT batch multiple issues into one AskUserQuestion. Use the preamble's AskUserQuestion Format section. The AskUserQuestion call is a tool_use, not prose — call the tool directly.

**STOP.** Do NOT proceed to the next review section, edit the plan file with the proposed fix, or call ExitPlanMode until the user responds. An issue with an "obvious fix" is still an issue and still needs explicit user approval before it lands in the plan. Loading the AskUserQuestion schema via ToolSearch and then writing the recommendation as chat prose is the failure mode this gate exists to prevent.

### 4. Performance review
Evaluate:
* N+1 queries and database access patterns.
* Memory-usage concerns.
* Caching opportunities.
* Slow or high-complexity code paths.

## Outside Voice — Independent Plan Challenge (optional, recommended)

Read `references/outside-voices-plan-challenge.md` and follow the instructions.
The reference contains: Codex availability check, independent review prompt,
cross-model consensus handling, and fallback to Claude subagent.

## CRITICAL RULE — How to ask questions
Follow the AskUserQuestion format from the Preamble above. Additional rules for plan reviews:
* **One issue = one AskUserQuestion call.** Never combine multiple issues into one question.
* Describe the problem concretely, with file and line references.
* Present 2-3 options, including "do nothing" where that's reasonable.
* For each option, specify in one line: effort (human: ~X / CC: ~Y), risk, and maintenance burden. If the complete option is only marginally more effort than the shortcut with CC, recommend the complete option.
* **Map the reasoning to my engineering preferences above.** One sentence connecting your recommendation to a specific preference (DRY, explicit > clever, minimal diff, etc.).
* Label with issue NUMBER + option LETTER (e.g., "3A", "3B").
* **Coverage vs kind:** for every per-issue AskUserQuestion you raise in this review, decide whether the options differ in coverage or in kind. If coverage (e.g., more tests vs fewer, complete error handling vs happy-path-only, full edge-case coverage vs shortcut), include `Completeness: N/10` on each option. If kind (e.g., architectural choice between two different systems, posture-over-posture, A/B/C where each is a different kind of thing), skip the score and add one line: `Note: options differ in kind, not coverage — no completeness score.` Do NOT fabricate scores on kind-differentiated questions — filler scores are worse than no score.
* **Zero findings:** if a section has zero findings, state "No issues, moving on" and proceed. Otherwise, use AskUserQuestion for each finding — a finding with an "obvious fix" is still a finding and still needs user approval before any change lands in the plan.

## Required outputs

### "NOT in scope" section
Every plan review MUST produce a "NOT in scope" section listing work that was considered and explicitly deferred, with a one-line rationale for each item.

### "What already exists" section
List existing code/flows that already partially solve sub-problems in this plan, and whether the plan reuses them or unnecessarily rebuilds them.

### TODOS.md updates
After all review sections are complete, present each potential TODO as its own individual AskUserQuestion. Never batch TODOs — one per question. Never silently skip this step.

각 TODO는 다음 형식으로 AskUserQuestion을 통해 개별 제시:
- **제목**: 한 줄 요약
- **우선순위**: P0/P1/P2
- **근거**: 리뷰에서 발견된 이유
선택지: A) TODOS.md에 추가 B) 건너뛰기 C) 이번 PR에서 바로 구현

For each TODO, describe:
* **What:** One-line description of the work.
* **Why:** The concrete problem it solves or value it unlocks.
* **Pros:** What you gain by doing this work.
* **Cons:** Cost, complexity, or risks of doing it.
* **Context:** Enough detail that someone picking this up in 3 months understands the motivation, the current state, and where to start.
* **Depends on / blocked by:** Any prerequisites or ordering constraints.

Then present options: **A)** Add to TODOS.md **B)** Skip — not valuable enough **C)** Build it now in this PR instead of deferring.

Do NOT just append vague bullet points. A TODO without context is worse than no TODO — it creates false confidence that the idea was captured while actually losing the reasoning.

### Diagrams
The plan itself should use ASCII diagrams for any non-trivial data flow, state machine, or processing pipeline. Additionally, identify which files in the implementation should get inline ASCII diagram comments — particularly Models with complex state transitions, Services with multi-step pipelines, and Concerns with non-obvious mixin behavior.

### Failure modes
For each new codepath identified in the test review diagram, list one realistic way it could fail in production (timeout, nil reference, race condition, stale data, etc.) and whether:
1. A test covers that failure
2. Error handling exists for it
3. The user would see a clear error or a silent failure

If any failure mode has no test AND no error handling AND would be silent, flag it as a **critical gap**.

### Worktree parallelization strategy

Analyze the plan's implementation steps for parallel execution opportunities. This helps the user split work across git worktrees (via Claude Code's Agent tool with `isolation: "worktree"` or parallel workspaces).

**Skip if:** all steps touch the same primary module, or the plan has fewer than 2 independent workstreams. In that case, write: "Sequential implementation, no parallelization opportunity."

**Otherwise, produce:**

1. **Dependency table** — for each implementation step/workstream:

| Step | Modules touched | Depends on |
|------|----------------|------------|
| (step name) | (directories/modules, NOT specific files) | (other steps, or —) |

Work at the module/directory level, not file level. Plans describe intent ("add API endpoints"), not specific files. Module-level ("controllers/, models/") is reliable; file-level is guesswork.

2. **Parallel lanes** — group steps into lanes:
   - Steps with no shared modules and no dependency go in separate lanes (parallel)
   - Steps sharing a module directory go in the same lane (sequential)
   - Steps depending on other steps go in later lanes

Format: `Lane A: step1 → step2 (sequential, shared models/)` / `Lane B: step3 (independent)`

3. **Execution order** — which lanes launch in parallel, which wait. Example: "Launch A + B in parallel worktrees. Merge both. Then C."

4. **Conflict flags** — if two parallel lanes touch the same module directory, flag it: "Lanes X and Y both touch module/ — potential merge conflict. Consider sequential execution or careful coordination."

## Implementation Tasks

Before closing this review, synthesize the findings above into a flat list of
build-actionable tasks. Each task derives from a specific finding — no padding.
Emit the markdown section AND write a JSONL artifact that `/autoplan` can
aggregate across phases.

### Markdown section (always emit)

```markdown
## Implementation Tasks
Synthesized from this review's findings. Each task derives from a specific
finding above. Run with Claude Code or Codex; checkbox as you ship.

- [ ] **T1 (P1, human: ~2h / CC: ~15min)** — <component> — <imperative title>
  - Surfaced by: <section name> — <specific finding text or line reference>
  - Files: <paths to touch>
  - Verify: <test command or manual check>
- [ ] **T2 (P2, human: ~30min / CC: ~5min)** — ...
```

Rules:
- P1 blocks ship; P2 should land same branch; P3 is a follow-up TODO.
- If a finding produced no actionable task, do not invent one.
- If a section had zero findings, emit `_No new tasks from <section>._`
- Effort uses the AI-compression table from CLAUDE.md.

### Completion summary
At the end of the review, fill in and display this summary so the user can see all findings at a glance:
- Step 0: Scope Challenge — ___ (scope accepted as-is / scope reduced per recommendation)
- Architecture Review: ___ issues found
- Code Quality Review: ___ issues found
- Test Review: diagram produced, ___ gaps identified
- Performance Review: ___ issues found
- NOT in scope: written
- What already exists: written
- TODOS.md updates: ___ items proposed to user
- Failure modes: ___ critical gaps flagged
- Outside voice: ran (codex/claude) / skipped
- Parallelization: ___ lanes, ___ parallel / ___ sequential
- Lake Score: X/Y recommendations chose complete option

## Retrospective learning
Check the git log for this branch. If there are prior commits suggesting a previous review cycle (e.g., review-driven refactors, reverted changes), note what was changed and whether the current plan touches the same areas. Be more aggressive reviewing areas that were previously problematic.

## Formatting rules
* NUMBER issues (1, 2, 3...) and LETTERS for options (A, B, C...).
* Label with NUMBER + LETTER (e.g., "3A", "3B").
* One sentence max per option. Pick in under 5 seconds.
* After each review section, pause and ask for feedback before moving on.

## Plan File Review Report

After completing the review, update the **plan file** so review status is visible.

### Detect the plan file

1. Check if there is an active plan file in this conversation (the host provides plan file
   paths in system messages — look for plan file references in the conversation context).
2. If not found, skip this section silently — not every review runs in plan mode.

### Generate the report

Using the results from your own review above, produce this table:

```markdown
## REVIEW REPORT

| Review | Trigger | Runs | Status | Findings |
|--------|---------|------|--------|----------|
| CEO Review | `/plan-ceo-review` | — | — | — |
| Eng Review | `/plan-eng-review` | {this run} | {status} | {summary from your Completion Summary} |
| Design Review | `/plan-design-review` | — | — | — |
| DX Review | `/plan-devex-review` | — | — | — |
```

Below the table:
- **UNRESOLVED:** total unresolved decisions from this review
- **VERDICT:** current review status (e.g., "ENG CLEARED — ready to implement")

### Write to the plan file

**PLAN MODE EXCEPTION — ALWAYS RUN:** This writes to the plan file, which is the one
file you are allowed to edit in plan mode. The plan file review report is part of the
plan's living status.

1. Read the plan file.
2. If an existing `## REVIEW REPORT` section exists, **replace it** entirely.
3. Append (or replace) the generated `## REVIEW REPORT` section as the **last section** of
   the plan file.

After writing, verify: the file's last `## ` heading is `## REVIEW REPORT`.

## Next Steps — Review Chaining

Check if additional reviews would be valuable based on what this eng review discovered.

**Suggest /plan-design-review if UI changes exist and no design review has been run** — detect from the test diagram, architecture review, or any section that touched frontend components, CSS, views, or user-facing interaction flows. If an existing design review's commit hash shows it predates significant changes found in this eng review, note that it may be stale.

**Mention /plan-ceo-review if this is a significant product change and no CEO review exists** — this is a soft suggestion, not a push. CEO review is optional. Only mention it if the plan introduces new user-facing features, changes product direction, or expands scope substantially.

**Note staleness** of existing CEO or design reviews if this eng review found assumptions that contradict them, or if the commit hash shows significant drift.

**If no additional reviews are needed** (or `skip_eng_review` is `true` in the dashboard config, meaning this eng review was optional): state "All relevant reviews complete. Run /ship when ready."
<!-- (미차용: 별도 도구로 대응) -->

Use AskUserQuestion with only the applicable options:
- **A)** Run /plan-design-review (only if UI scope detected and no design review exists)
- **B)** Run /plan-ceo-review (only if significant product change and no CEO review exists)
- **C)** Ready to implement — run /ship when done
<!-- (미차용: 별도 도구로 대응) -->

## Unresolved decisions
If the user does not respond to an AskUserQuestion or interrupts to move on, note which decisions were left unresolved. At the end of the review, list these as "Unresolved decisions that may bite you later" — never silently default to an option.

## EXIT PLAN MODE GATE (BLOCKING)

Read `references/exit-plan-mode-gate.md` and execute the self-check.
Do NOT call ExitPlanMode until all checks pass.
